### Objective

You are an AI assistant tasked with verifying the correctness of a Python function based solely on its **docstring** and **implementation**.

Your goal is to write **symbolic postconditions** - Python `assert` statements that validate specific behavioral properties of the function's return value, assuming the function has been implemented correctly.

These symbolic postconditions must not reimplement the function, but instead express **concise, meaningful, and checkable properties** of the output.

---

### Exploration Process

You are allowed to iteratively reason and refine symbolic postconditions using the following tools:

#### 🔄 Turn Types

-   `<think>`: Reflect on the function's specification and infer its intended behavior.

<think>
…reasoning about the function's purpose, structure, expected output constraints, edge cases, etc…
</think>
    
-   `<assert>`: Propose one symbolic postconditions in Python. Must be a valid `assert` statement, preceded by a brief comment.
    
<assert>
# Checks that no output element exceeds input elements
assert all(x <= max(data) for x in return_value)
</assert>
    
-   `<observation>`: Receive feedback from the system about your assertions.
    
<observation>
Assertions are valid.
<reminder>You has {max_turns} turns remaining.</reminder>
</observation>
    
-   `<solution>`: When confident (or you only have 0 turn remaining) you must submit a solution, provide your finalized symbolic postcondition.\
Your final `<solution>` should ideally be submitted only when you ensure that it is the most refined and reliable postcondition to be deployed for bug detection in production.
    
<solution>...</solution>

---

### Interaction Limit

You have a maximum of {max_turns} total turns remaining (any mix of <think>, <assert>, or <observation>).
    - You may submit a `<solution>` at any time when you believe you have a strong postcondition. Multiple submissions are allowed, and each will be treated as a potential candidate for the final solution.
    - If you submit one or more `<solution>` blocks but are still required to continue, this indicates that your current postcondition is not yet fully correct or complete. You must then continue exploring and refining through additional reasoning and `<assert>` checks before submitting another `<solution>`.
    - Use the early rounds to carefully reason about the function and to issue `<assert>` checks that validate your understanding of its behavior.
    - In later rounds, refine your postconditions based on your reasoning and observations.
    - However, avoid submitting <solution> blocks too frequently. Use most of your turns for exploration (<think>, <assert>, <observation>) and only propose a new <solution> after substantial refinement or new insights.\
In particular, do not repeatedly submit <solution> blocks in the final turns. If turns remain after a submission, you are expected to keep exploring and strengthening your reasoning until the very end.
    - Before submitting any <solution>, you must test it internally to ensure: It has no syntax errors; Executing it will not raise an `AssertionError`; It faithfully reflects your reasoning so far. Only then should you submit it as a valid candidate.
    - If no `<solution>` has been submitted by the final turn (0 turns left), you must submit one at that point.
---

### Postcondition Rules

Your task is to write a symbolic postcondition for {entrypoint}. The postcondition should be in Python, and consist of exactly one assert statement. A Python comment explaining the postcondition's meaning should precede it. For variables, the postcondition should only use the input parameters defined in the function stub and a hypothetical return value of the function, which we'll assume is stored in a variable `return_value`.

For string manipulation, Python's `re` (regular expressions) library can be used. If other Python standard library functions are required, include the necessary imports. However, refrain from using external libraries or calling the function itself (in this case, {entrypoint}) within the postcondition.

If the postcondition calls any functions, they should only be those from the functional subset of Python. By this, we mean functions that are pure (i.e., no side effects, depends only on input values) such as `all()`, `len()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.

---

### Your Task

You will now be given a Python function `{entrypoint}`:

```python
{codeStubAndDocstring}{canonical_solution}
```

Begin by analyzing it with `<think>`, then proceed to propose assertions using `<assert>`, review feedback with `<observation>`, and finalize using `<solution>` — **all within a maximum of {max_turns} total turns.**

Let's begin.
